How to execute:
    
    * generate DEMs for each thalweg (runFEtchData.py??)
    * Analysis of AMA data, Fit analysis, intensity analysis, spatial analysis (runFetchDataAnalyseFit.py)
    * Plotting results -> last section of runFetchDataAnalyseFit.py
    * Plotting functions in thalwegPlotsMEDIAN.py
        * plotBoxplot => violinplot function creates one violin if split is not defined, creates multiple 
                         violins next to each other (including summery plot) if split is defined
        * plotScatterplot => creates scatterplots with different parameters on the x- and y-axis 
    * thalwegPlots.py => pre version of thalwegPlotsMEDIAN, calculates means instead of median
    * ComparisonPlot.py => hardcoded script to plot AMA results in comparison with international classification
    * ThalwegPaula.py => imports .csv with coordinates of thalwegs and calculates quantitative characteristics accordingly to the AMA analysis,
        using fitting method to define D-point
    * runFetchDataAnalyseEvent.py => calculates spatial characteristics until the runout point (event dense point)
