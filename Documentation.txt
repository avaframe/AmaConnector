How to execute:
    
    * generate DEMs for each thalweg (runExportEventsData.py)
    * Analysis of AMA data, Fit analysis, intensity analysis, spatial analysis (runFetchDataAnalyseNew.py)
    * Plotting results -> last section of runFetchDataAnalyseNew.py
    * Plotting functions in thalwegPlotsMEDIAN.py
        * plotBoxplot => violinplot function creates one violin if split is not defined, creates multiple 
                         violins next to each other (including summery plot) if split is defined
    * runFetchDataAnalyseNew.py => calculates spatial characteristics until the runout point (event dense point)
